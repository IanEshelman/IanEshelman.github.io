summary: My group created a website for companies and UH students to find each other. 
---

  For my Software Engineering class (ICS 314) our final project was to create a website that either solved a problem, provided a service, or both. My group decieded to create a site that would help Univeristy of Hawaii students to get in contact with companies that are looking for new hires. They way we decided to do this was by allowing students and recruiters to make their own profiles with contact information, interests, and a description/summary. Then students would be able to look for companies that had created profiles and vice-versa. The lists of companies and students could be filtered by tags that each user could add to their profile that described their interests such as "C++" or "Web Design".

  I personally worked on developing the Admin and Student landing pages that they would see upon logging in. I also created the company data that populates the site upon initial deployment as well as assisted with getting the account creation process to function.

  One of the most important things that I learned from this project is how hard it can be to work asyncronously with teammates and the different ways to mitigate that difficulty. Everyone in my group, including myself, were super busy during the period that we were working on this project. We all had some form of work or other finals that we were worrying about, which made it hard for there to be a time that we were all on at the same time to discuss. We basically had our two weekly meetings to discuss tasks, then everything else was talked about though text whenever an issue or bug occurred. By divying up tasks, we were able to make sure that everyone had something to work on when they were avaliable, and we also tried to not have any one person's task depend on the completetion of someone else's. I feel like we could have done better work if we all found more time to work together as a group, but our organizational structure allowed us to make a product that I can be proud of.
