Everyone in the field of computer science decided on their caerer path for one reason or another. Some people do it because of the money, others like video games and want to become game devs, and there are people that do it out of pure love for technology. I myself want to be a full-fledged computer scientist because I love problem solving and making people's lives easier, and programming can help me satisfy both of those desires. 

Living in Hawaii, my physical sphere of influence is restrained to this island and the things that I can do on it. This means that my ability to help others has been limited to service projects and teaching roles that I have been in. Learning to program and develop software will help me to expand my sphere of influence to be much wider, potentially encompassing the whole world. I want to be able to develop apps and programs that either make a difference in the world, or programs that simplify tedious tasks to help people save time. 

I am specifically most interested in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as I believe that utilizing those strategies will help solve problems that would not be able to be solved by conventional programming means. With the amount of data that can be collected by things such as social media, studying it all on our own is basically impossible, but it can be analyzed and turned into usable statistics with data science. Learning new ways to implement these strategies in ways that will reveal new connections in data is very exciting to me.
