Sites and forums such as StackOverflow have become extremly important to the global network of programmers and developers. If you ever get stuck trying to make an algoritm or trhoubleshoot a function, StackOverflow will either have the answer, or someone who can amswer your question. However, as anyone who has asked a question on the site should know, if you don't put any work into your question, your question will be ridiculed, locked, and downvoted into oblivion. Luckily, as long as you put some effort into googling your issue and writing your question in an informed way, you can get high-quality help. 

To provide an example of a poorly worderd question, we have this one [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26439695/10-pin-bowling-score-calculator-in-javascript) by user "enigma coder". Their post is very short, so I'll quote it in its entierty here:
>I have been tasked with creating a bowling score calculator in javascript.
>I am a complete newbie to javascript so I'm not sure where to start. Are there any simple examples of this specific project I can use as reference?
>I keep finding long and convoluted code for it that doesn't make much sense...
This post makes it very obvious that the poster did some work in the form of searching for a full code answer, but did not include any of the examples that they found that confused them. They also did not provide any of the specifics that this project required of them such as wether there needs to be a UI, or even how the data for the scores should be stored. This lack of information is called out in the responses, one of which is more in-depth than a post like this deserves. Said in-depth answer took the time to write out a generic framework for OP and the steps that they could take to find the answers they need. This is really the only way to provide a good solution to the post because there was so little provided information to work with. The other answer is a good example of why providing the solutions that you've already found and/or tried is important. They just provide a block of code that solves the problem without explaining the process behind creating the code or how it even functions. If the OP had provided one of the solutions they say they'd found and exlpained which parts confused them, then the responses could explain the difficult parts in greater detail.
