As someone who learned programming by starting with languages like C++ and Java, Javascript was always a foriegn concept to me. Programming communities that I've visited have always sung praises of the Object-Oriented languages, and talked down on Javascript as if it were a completely inferior language. Having practiced with the basics of Javascript and ES6, I don't quite understand all the hate, and I actually really enjoy the differences that the language brings to the table.

The entire idea of being able to utilize a function like a variable and pass a function into another is extremely interesing. That concept alone allows for many new ways to streamline and structure code that wouldnt be possible with a language by C++. I also appreciate the quality-of-life syntax that ES6 provides, especially the destructuring arguments, as those allow for clean and compact code that also reads well. 

As for the actual learning process, utilizing the "Athletic Software Engineering" strategy of practicing on small projects has been really useful for learning the nuances of Javascript. Normally, I'll have issues when starting a new language, or using a language I haven't used in a while, because the syntax is slightly different from what I am used to and I contsantly make small errors because of that. However, after a day or two, the muscle memory kicks in and the mistakes go away. Doing a small project and then being able to sleep on it helps to cement that muscle memory for the future projects that I need to work on in that language.
